You'll never stand on your two feet
You'll never break the mould
A life of mediocrity
Forget your hopes and industry
Forget your big ideas
It's just sociology


So I'm a fool, need to listen to you
And you're so great
So Arsène Lupin would never approve of me
And you're so great
So what are these words that you want me to say?
Du fric, des balles, de l'oseille
Du pognon, les banlieues en Argenteuil
I'm going to be a millionaire
Just one of these days
No matter what you say
I’m going to make it some day

Come take my hand, you must understand
Your dreams are all but just dreams
Come take my hand, I'll show you the land
Of what reality means

You'll never make it on your own
No! You're wrong

You'll never make it on your own
No! You're wrong

So queue up and get into line
We're going to take back control
We're going to control radio
Don't ever attempt original
You see it's just not in your genes
It's just zoological

So sir you are better than them
And you're so great
You have black friends, you have white friends
And you're so great
So you might wear a safety pin
Stay in and read the guardian
Just click your way to a revolution
But you're the problem not the solution

Come take my hand, I'll show you the land
Of what reality means

You'll never make it on your own
No! You're wrong

You'll never make it on your own
No! You're wrong

I'm stronger than you!
Hell no!
I'm better than you!
Hell no!
I'm smarter  than you!
Hell no!
Better looking than you!
Hell no!
Come and ride with us!
I said no!
Just believe in us!
I just said No!

We'll make it on our own!
No!
No you're wrong!

We'll make it on our own!
No!
No you're wrong!

We'll make it on our own! 
No!
No you're wrong!

We'll make it on our own! 
No! No you're wrong!

We'll make it on our own!
