Duck Thieves are a band described as Indie Panto Party Pop with a slice of punk performance art thrown in.  Formed in Coventry, they write songs that are inspired by personal story-telling, feminism, standing up to racism and B-Movies. On stage, the band exude an explosive energy, captivating stage presence and unpredictable theatrics. 

Duck Thieves have played on the main stage at Godiva Festival and supported The Specials at their homecoming gig at Coventry Cathedral ruins.

They have released several singles and EPs to critical acclaim including 'Act One', 'Dance Like a Duck Thief' and 'In Liverpool We’ll Barn Dance'.

The band take their name after the first ever film made in Hong Kong, ‘Stealing a Roasted Duck’, which was destroyed and consequently no one alive has seen.

Duck Thieves are to release their new 'Eyes Up Here' EP in April.
